ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm Francisco - a full stack developer from Argentina. With Laravel and Angular, I bring complex web applications to life with a focus on usability and mantainability.

My current work has me developing (along my team) a custom waste management system for smart cities utilizing both Laravel (PHP) and Angular (Typescript), but I have experience with Node.js too. I'm proficient in both back-end and front-end development, and I enjoy finding ways to optimize and improve the performance of applications.

My experience in web development has given me an understanding of the importance of clean and readable code. And I believe that collaborating with other developers is the key to solving technical challenges and developing scalable solutions.

If you're searching for a skilled and dedicated full stack developer to join your team, feel free to reach out. I'm always up for new challenges and love contributing to successful projects.
